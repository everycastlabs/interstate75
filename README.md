# Interstate 75
## Pico, Pico W and Pico 2 W powered HUB75 Matrix Drivers

This repository is home to the MicroPython firmware and examples for
Interstate 75, Interstate 75W and Interstate 75 .. 2W?.

## Download Firmware

There are two choices, a regular build that just updates the firmware on
your board and a "-with-examples" build which includes a ready-to-go set
of examples (everything in [examples/launcher](examples/launcher))
that you can interact with right on your display.

:warning: If you've changed any of the code on your board then back up before
flashing "-with-examples" - *your files will be erased!*
